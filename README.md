# COPD dataset Description

## Study Description
---
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disease characterized by persistent irreversible airflow obstruction. And COPD has become the fourth leading cause of mortality in China because of its high morbidity and mortality. This project collected 5578 questionnaires from six cities in different regions of China from January, 2017 to June, 2021

This project is a sub-project of the key project of the National Key R&D Program of China "Study on the Prevention and Control of Major Chronic Non-Infectious Diseases" —"Clinical Bioinformatics-Based Research on the Risk Factors, Etiology and Pathogenesis Mechanism of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease". This project started in January 2017 and ends in June 2021. Because of communication, funding, transmission constraints, data collection and data aggregation continued until December 2021

The population cohorts in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, were recruited by the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The population cohort in Shanghai was recruited from Zhongshan Hospital, FuDan University, the Central Hospital of Minhang District, Shanghai, and Shanghai Fengxian District Central Hospital. The population cohort in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, was recruited by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. The population cohort in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, was recruited from the Henan Provincial People's Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The study cohort in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, was recruited by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. All participants signed an informed consent form
